# Scrabble WPF

This is a Scrabble-like game where letters are placed on a 7x7 board to form words.
It is a 2-player game, with options to check if the word you placed is valid,
replace all the words in your hand and to pass your turn. Your word can't be
submitted until it has been 'checked'. Points are earned based on the 'value' of
the letters played. After all the available tiles have been taken, the game ends and
the player with the most points wins. The players points are then uploaded onto
the Leaderboard, which shows all past scores.
